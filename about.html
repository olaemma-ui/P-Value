            Purpose
        </h4>
        <p class="text-cente">
            R has many packages out of which tidyverse is included. 
            This package is so loaded to contain many other packages like ggplot2, dplyr, readr, stringr, purrr, tidyr, among others. 
            Each of these has industrial applications. 
            We intend to train a set of people (selected from both academia and industries) on the use of tidyverse package. 
            It is strongly believed that the symposium will go a long way in reducing some difficulties encountered by researchers while using tidyverse package. 
            This will also promote the use of R software within and outside our locality. 
            R users across board are expected to gather and share knowledge on this peculiar package - tidyverse.
        </p>
